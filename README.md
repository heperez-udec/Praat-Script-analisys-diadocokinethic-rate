 This is a script for computing four quantitative metrics of diadochokinetic rate in digital speech samples. Notably, the script computes the average number 
 of syllables per second, the coefficient of variability of the average number of syllables per second, average syllable length, and the coefficient of 
 variability of average syllable length in diadochokinetic sequences.

A video tutorial will be available soon.
